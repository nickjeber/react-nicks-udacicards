My first Udacicards!!! 

My third, and final app in the Udacity React course. A native application. 

To install and run, these are the steps I personally would follow, but there are a couple of ways (MAC based): 

1. Download XCode
2. Clone from Git repository
3. Navigate to the directory and run yarn install
4. Run yarn start
5. Press 'i' for the XCode IOS simulator
6. If cache needs to be cleared run yarn cache clean

Enjoy!
